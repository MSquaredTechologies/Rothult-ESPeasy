**Hacking an IKEA Rothult NFC lock to be remotely controlled by a NodeMCU and HTTP request**

I liked the idea of jah64's implementation for the lock but i dont like using the HTTP broker. Also i did not have any Wemos modules at hand, only NodeMCUs. 

So, this guide shows how to connect it to a NodeMCU to control it remotely over WiFi using HTTP.



**Rothult connections with NodeMCU **

This is approx. how the driver circuits on the original PCB look like, and the needed connections are shown to the right. Two 1k (or 1k2 as in the picture) are needed to be put in series with the control signals. If you intend to disable the NFC, then you can skip the extra resistors and instead connect to the opposite side of resistors R12/R13.
Following the colors you can see how the NodeMCU is connected to Rothult.

**Disabling NFC**

To disable NFC we can simply put the onboard MCU in permanent reset by shorting the capacitor C2 (magenta marking). 
Solder a thin wire between it's ends, or remove it completely and solder the pads together.

**Final result**

In order to fit the NodeMCU to the battery compartment, extra headers have to be desoldered.  
so drill a hole in the side of the housing (where the battery compartment is inserted) and guide the wires out. Solder them to the D1 with 
some slack, and tuck it into the compartment while sliding it into place.

The screw for the compartment can be removed if you like to simplify the assembly, and the compartment will still stay in place quite firmly, or you can use the screw without the C-clip.

It's a good idea to remove the metal tab connectors between cells in the compartment to avoid short circuits, they can be pulled out with a pair of pliers or be covered with some tape.

To supply power the lock you can e.g. use a cut USB cable and a Ikea SMÃ…HAGEL charger( https://www.ikea.com/se/en/p/smahagel-3-port-usb-charger-white-60539177/) which should provide enough power. Drill a hole somewere and route the cable in. 
Solder the red and black wires to +5V/GND (or B+/B-) as I've done in the pictures below.  
Remember to fix the cable with e.g. som hot-glue or super-glue.

When reassembling, remember to put back the small roller on the pin that has likely fallen off while flipping the unit around.

## ESPeasy setup

In the original guide, the ESPeasy image flashing is not covered. 

I'm not covering the basic setup of ESPeasy here and assume that you have flashed the image and established contact before continuing.
My version of ESPeasy when writing this is ESPeasy_mega-20200801 (image file: 'ESP_Easy_mega_20200801_normal_ESP8266_4M1M.bin').


I recommend that you use my settings and topic names etc as much as possible to minimize possible errors during first tests. You can modify to your liking later.
Change only the IP and credentials needed to work with your broker, and name the ESP to 'ESP8266-11-D1'. Be meticulous on spelling names, topics etc exactly correct.

**HTTP controller setup**

**Enable RULES**

**Paste in the rules from the 'rules.txt' file**

The rules deviate from the orignal, since we are not using HTTP to send data.

### Test HTTP

If everything works, the lock will drive to the locked position automatically after reboot/power-on. If it's allready in the locked position, nothing should happen.

Time to try some HTTP commands.


For testing the lock, you can find a Android app from the Play Store called "HTTP shortcuts"

For the locking function

http://'LockIP'/control?cmd=event,Lock=1
For the unlocking
http://'LockIP'/control?cmd=event,Lock=0

To test the locking function. 

You should now see 'cmd = event Lock=0' in the explorer tree, and hopefully the lock reacted. If nothing happened, then try changing the '0' to a '1' in the payload and PUBLISH again.

All commands are sent to the #/cmd topic, and "event " must be present in the payload.

Available commands (payloads) are:  
"event Lock=0"   unlock  
"event Lock=1"   lock  
"event Cfg1=xx"  xx sets the number of milliseconds the motor reverses after end detection  
"event Cfg2=yy"  yy sets the number of seconds before automatically locking after unlocking. 0=Auto disabled  
"event Step=0"   run motor forward a short time, debugging  
"event Step=1"   run motor reverse a short time, debugging  


If nothing happened, troubleshoot... ðŸ˜€


## Future ideas


Currently, this setup is used for a simple door lock. An local Flask web server 

A word of warning when you start laborating with the rules/code...   
The motor H-bridge doesn't seem to have any protection for driving both directions simultaneously, which could result in letting the magic smoke out of the transistors.
Therefore, ALWAYS be sure to turn off the driver for opposite direction BEFORE activating the intended direction.

On power fail, with NFC enabled, the NFC credentials will be forgotten and the lock will unlock. 
The ESP can also make a slightly uncontrolled startup on power fail/restart and cycle the bolt a whole turn.  
Therefore it could be beneficial with a battery backup.  
A powerbank might be the first thing you think of, but they are generally not useable for this.  
However, a backup should be fairly simple to arrange with only one or two diodes (prefeerable schottky) and a battery pack. 
Three AA cells (alkaline or NiMH) or maybe even a single LiIon (e.g. 18650) should suffice, giving hours of backup time. 
If using NiMH cells, then they can probably be charged in-circuit using a single resistor.  
I haven't tried this yet, but it should work.

Another good idea would be to have wires to the motor (M+/M-) pulled out to some accessible but hidden/unsuspicious place. 
That will make emergency opening possible by momentarily applying 3-5V from e.g. batteries.

On the software side, a better syncronization on reset would be good, or maybe a dedicated Arduino sketch instead of ESPeasy to gain better motor control. 
Maybe write a 'Rothult' plugin for ESPeasy?
